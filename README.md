# Black-Foot-Language-Learning-App üó£Ô∏èüß†

This project is a Python audio-visual Language Learning App for the endangered Canadian Indigenous Language, Blackfoot.

The App consists of three parts:

1. Learn: While listening to the audio, an image is shown to the user. By pressing the enter key, users can listen to words and view the matching image.

2. Play: The audio of a word is played to the user. Then, several images are displayed some of which are overlapped. Users enter their count of the number of images shown that match with the spoken word. Depending on their answer, users will be informed if their answer is correct

3. Settings: The regular setting allows users to learn three words at a time. However, they can choose more words to learn (up to ten) as they continue with the game.
